"""
  Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its
  powerset.
  The powerset P(X) of a set X is the set of all
  subsets of X. For example, the powerset of [1,2] is [[], [1], [2], [1,2]].

  Note that the sets in the powerset do not need to be in any particular order.
Sample Input:
array = [1, 2, 3]
Sample Output: 
[[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
