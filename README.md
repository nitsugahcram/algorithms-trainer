# Algorithm Trainer

Time ago, I found an area for improvement in relation with 


* Data Structure
 * Basic data structures: Array, String, Boolean, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, 2-dimensional Array, Set, Binary Trees
* Complexity Analysis
* Understanding Big O Notation, runtime complexity, and space complexity help you write efficient algorithms.
* Algorithms
 * Heap, HashTable, Variations of Tree, Graph (DFS, BFS)
 * Recursions
 * Dynamic Programming
 * Backtracking (for example, solving the N-Queen problem, sudoku)
 * Bit Manipulation
 * Object-oriented programming
 * System design
 * Medium to hard coding problems on Leetcode, HackerRank

The categories of problems are:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Linked Lists
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BT, BSTs)
* Famous Algorithms
* Graphs
* Heaps
* Stacks
* Sorting/Searching
* Recursion


**The Difficulty Levels:**

:white_circle: Easy: 0

:large_blue_circle: Medium: 0

:red_circle: Hard: 0  

:black_circle: Very Hard: 0

:star: Good to review

__Totals__: 0

I've decided to track my daily algo practice to hone my computer science / data structure skills
