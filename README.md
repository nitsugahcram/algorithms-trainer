# Algorithm Trainer

Time ago, I found an area for improvement in relation with 

* Data Structure
 * Basic data structures: Array, String, Boolean, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, 2-dimensional Array, Set, Binary Trees
* Complexity Analysis
* Understanding Big O Notation, runtime complexity, and space complexity help you write efficient algorithms.
* Algorithms
 * Heap, HashTable, Variations of Tree, Graph (DFS, BFS)
 * Recursions
 * Dynamic Programming
 * Backtracking (for example, solving the N-Queen problem, sudoku)
 * Bit Manipulation
 * Object-oriented programming
 * System design
 * Medium to hard coding problems on Leetcode






I've decided to track my daily algo practice to hone my computer science / data structure skills
